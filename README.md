How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
There are many ways that I ensured my code, program, and software was functional and secure. Some ways were implementing Junit testing, which allowed for me to ensure that the code is tested and working correctly. It gave me a percentage of how muhc of the code is being tested and I was able to work on adding more testing methods that would increase the percentage of the code tested. It gives you a flat out percentage of how well your code is. Some methods that I used were unit tests, integration tests, and end to end testing. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I prioritized the users needs and requirements when developing the code. I made sure to take the requirments and code each of them one by one. This allowed me to ensure that I satisfied the requirments. I think this is the most important thing about development. If you do not satisfy the requirments, you aren't creating the software that they are asking you to develop. 

How do I approach designing software?
I first start by reading what the tasks is and what the requirments of the client are. I then develop a plan to satisfy these requirments. I make sure that the code does each of the functions requested and then i develop testing methods to ensure that they are working correctly.
